# House-Mortgage-Dataset-Analysis
#### Part-1 Exploratory Dataset Analysis Home Mortgage NY 
     - Loading and analyzing dataset
     - Vizualizing the dataset
     - Buiding a classification model to decide which predictors are most important
     - Calculating the accuracy of the model by plotting ROC curve
    
    
#### Part-2
The main aim of the project was to predict whether a mortgage application will be accepted or not. Dataset was extracted from AER package in R.

#### Steps involved:
     --Data extraction and cleansing
     --Outliers detection using QQ-Plot and box-plots
     --Skewness detection using density plots
     --Model fitting using GLM
     --Model selection using forward and hybrid methods
     --Choosing the best model using ANOVA
     --Predicting the model accuracy 
     --Plotting the ROC curve 
     --Conclusion:
       On the basis of various analysis performed; the most significant predictors are:
       Payment to Income Ratio
       Loan to value ratio  
       Credit history: consumer payments
       Public bad credit record
       Insurance
       Ethnicity
       Marital status
